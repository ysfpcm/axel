How do modifiers (if any) work with your menu items?\nYour DeliverMe online ordering site is a flexible, easy to use platform for you and your customers.

    "title": "Define Custom Variables",
    "content": "Last Updated: \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tJune 14, 2023\nCustom variables allow you to edit multiple data fields throughout Exatouch. Details such as staff type, floor plan components, payout types, and transaction reasons can be defined as custom variables. Item details such as size, color, and style are defined for reporting purposes.\n\nCustom variables are defined under Settings > Preferences. Each custom variable type has a unique set of requirements associated with it. The process of defining custom variables varies by type; some variables require information such as “unit” to be assigned.\nThis is an example of how to define variables for the Item Color group:\nFrom Home, navigate to Settings > Preferences.\nTap the Custom Vars (custom variables) tab.\nIn the Type section, select Item Color, then tap Add Line to add colors.\nEnter a new color.\nDelete colors by tapping Delete next to an entry.\nTap Save.\n\nTip! Check your work! Navigate to the Inventory tab on the Item Details page to view choices in the Color drop-down menu.\n\n\nNote: Custom variables can work in conjunction with custom buttons by defining functions used to create custom buttons. See: Difference between Custom Buttons and Custom Variables\nSelect a custom variable type to learn what custom variables can do for you:\nMerchants can create user-defined fields to track items on a granular level. Under Items Details, there are three user-defined fields. Labels for these fields are assigned via custom variables. Once labels are defined, each label (maximum of 3) displays as a custom report in Sales Reports and/or Advanced Sales Reports. Additional steps are needed in order for user-defined reporting to be functional.\nExample: In reviewing their menu offerings, a Mexican restaurant wants to determine which appetizers, entrees, and desserts are the most popular. User-defined fields can be Appetizers, Entrees, and Desserts.\nImpact: Item Details.  Look for the user-defined field drop-downs.  In order for reporting to be fully functional, drop-down content must be defined, and values need to be chosen.\nReports: Navigate to Reports > Sales, and find the names of reports you defined (maximum 3.)\n\n\nStaff type describes an employee’s role. Create different staff roles to display on an employee profile via Custom Variables. Staff type is not related to access permissions in Exatouch.\nExample: Cashier, Cook, Dishwasher, Manager\nImpact: Staff Details. Look for the “Staff type” field on an employee record.\nReports: N/A\nSee: Create Staff Types and  Difference between Staff Type and User Type\n\n\nFloor plans can be broken down into zones for organized management. Labels for “Floor Plan Zones” are defined via custom variables.\nExample: Main Dining, Bar, Patio\nImpact: Floor Plan Zone labels appear immediately after they are defined via custom variables.\nReports: N/A\n\n\n\nItem size, color, and style are Item-level information used for reporting purposes and/or with Matrix Inventory.\n\nSee: Add Size Options and Add Color Options\n\nExample: A shoe store describes their shoes using Item colors: beige, black, blue; Item size: women’s 5, women’s 6 … women’s 11; Item style: narrow, medium, wide.\nImpact: Item Details, in the Size, Color and Style drop-downs.\nReports: Size, Color, and Style are included in the Sales Reports: Sales by Size, Sales by Color, Sales by Style, and Sales by Matrix. Items List has a “size” column, and “Advanced item search” can filter by size, color, and style.\n\nTip! Size, Color, and Style variables can also be updated on the Items Details page by tapping the “GEAR” icon next to each field.\n\nRevenue Center and Revenue Class are item-level information used for detailed reporting purposes. Data from Revenue Center and Revenue Class fields are designed to display on Business Overview and Snapshot reports. While Revenue center and Revenue class are separate criteria, they can be used together.\nExample 1: Retail store uses Revenue Center to track overall liquor sales. Revenue Center: Liquor\nExample 2: Retail store uses Revenue Center and Revenue Class together to track specific liquor sales. Revenue Center: Liquor; Revenue Class: Brandy, Rum, Vodka\nImpact: Directly impacts Items Details. See Revenue Center and Revenue Class drop-downs. To fully benefit from Revenue center and class labels, labels need to be applied within Items Details.Tip! Revenue Center and Revenue Class can be edited directly by selecting the gear icon next to the field.\nTip! Revenue Center and Revenue Class can be edited directly by selecting the gear icon next to the field.\nReports: “Business Overview Report” and “Snapshot Reports”\n\n\nItem manufacturer data is used for reporting purposes which are unrelated to vendors or purchase orders.\nExample 1: Retailers that deal in auto parts often use manufacturer part numbers and create manufacturer variables which correspond to part numbers.\nExample 2: Firestone, Sumitomo, Goodyear.\nImpact: Item Details. Look for the Manufacturer and Manufacturer Part # drop-down menus.Tip! Item manufacturer can be edited directly from Item Details by selecting the gear icon next to the field.\nTip! Item manufacturer can be edited directly from Item Details by selecting the gear icon next to the field.\nReports: Manufacturer details are displayed in Manufacturer Report and in Advanced Reports, located in Sales Reports.\n\n\nModifier Pages expand modifier offerings at the register. Modifier pages are often associated with ratios. Ratios must be defined as whole numbers. Pizzerias often use modifier pages to describe pizza toppings.\nExample: A pizzeria defines the following modifier pages:\n\nWhole Topping – Ratio 100.00\n1/2 Topping – Ratio 50.00\n1/4 Topping – Ratio 25.00\nWhole Topping – Ratio 100.00\n1/2 Topping – Ratio 50.00\n1/4 Topping – Ratio 25.00\n\nImpact: The Register, on orders with MODS. View Modifier Pages when the MOD window pops-up at the register. While Modifers Page labels appear immediately at the register, further steps are needed for full functionality.\nReports: N/A\n\nSee: How to Use Modifier Pages and Organize Modifier Pages\n\n\n\nRestaurants can assign custom labels to their courses.\nExample: Beverages, Appetizers, Entree, Dessert\nImpact: Coursing at the register. Select “Course Seats” to add course entries, and view the course labels.\nReports: N/A\n\nNote: Course labels are used in conjunction with course firing. For full functionality, enable printer preferences for course firing.  See: Setup Course Firing Printer Preferences and Rename Restaurant Courses\n\nInstructions provide additional detail on applying MODS to an order. This is especially helpful to restaurants who communicate specific instructions to kitchen staff before an order is prepared. Up to 8 custom Instruction variables can be defined.\nExample: An Italian restaurant applies these instructions to clarify their modifiers: Extra $, Add $. Associated modifiers include: Olives, Onions, Peppers. A customer orders a “House Salad” with “Extra” + “Olives.” “Extra” is an instruction on how to apply “Olives.”\nImpact: The Register, when a MOD is added to the order. Instructions appear as GREEN buttons in the MOD section. Note the total price difference when adding Optional Modifiers, such as Extra Bacon.\nReports: N/A\n\nTip! Don’t forget to double-tap “All Modifiers” to clear the instruction button after selections are complete.\nSee: Create Instruction Modifiers\n\nTrack pre-defined reasons for voids and refunds in reports. These fields are optional but can be set to “required” in Settings.\nExample: Incorrect Price, Damaged Item\nImpact: The Register. Refund is located on the Global Menu by default. Orders can be voided from the Open orders window. When a refund is processed, the user is prompted to enter a refund reason. When a void is processed, the user is prompted to enter a reason for the void.\nReports: “Refund/Void Report,” located under Reports > Sales.\n\n\nTrack instances of company pay-ins for reporting purposes.\nExample 1: A convenience store returns unsold magazines to the vendor for reimbursement. “Vendor Reimbursement” is considered a “Company Pay In.”\nExample 2: Change (i.e. nickels, dimes, quarters) from a company payout can be considered a company pay in – “Payout Change”\nImpact: The Register. Company pay ins are processed on the Order Details tab at the Register. When pay ins are processed, merchants are prompted to select a reason for the pay in.\nReports: “Pay in/out Report,” located under Reports > Sales.\n\n\nTrack reasons for company payouts on reports.\nExamples: Inventory, Supplies, Expenses\nImpact: The Register. Company payouts are processed on the Order Details tab at the Register. When payouts are processed, merchants are prompted to select a reason for the payout.\nReports: “Pay in/out Report,” located under Reports > Sales.\n\n\nTrack reasons for customer payouts on reports.\nExample: Lottery, Events, Promotions\nImpact: The Register. When customer payouts are processed, merchants are prompted to select a payout reason.\nReports: “Pay in/out Report,” located in Sales Reports\n\nSee: Process Customer Payouts and Setup Quick Payout\n\n\n\nThis variable helps merchants sell “by-fraction” items while deducting the weight of the container (aka tare weight). Container weight is an Item-level variable, and each container type is assigned a weight and a unit.\nExample: An ice cream store sells different size ice cream cups by weight. They don’t want to include the container weight in their sales, so “Container Weight” variables are created for different types of containers, each corresponding to weight and unit: SM/0.1000/lb, MED/0.2000/lb, LG/0.3000/lb.\nImpact: The Register. When a “sold by fraction” item is rung up, container weight options pop-up for selection.Tip! A “New Container” variable can be created directly from the Select Container pop-up.\nTip! A “New Container” variable can be created directly from the Select Container pop-up.\nReports: N/A\n\nNote: “Sold-by-fraction” weight and “Container Weight” need to be the same for proper functionality. If these weights are different, container weight will not display at the Register.\n\nAllows restaurants to display custom order types which are displayed on kitchen receipts, informing kitchen staff how to prepare an order. Custom order type can be set to default at the time of setup.\nEach Custom Order variable is assigned an order “Type.” Each order type has a set of characteristics:\nDine In: does not require customer info, no delivery address\nTake Out: requires customer info, no delivery address\nPick Up: requires customer info\nDelivery: requires customer info and a valid delivery address; Delivery orders can be used with the Delivery Manager\nExample: Restaurants with call-in orders create these custom order types: Pick Up, Delivery, Delivery Service.\nImpact: Custom Buttons and the Register. After Custom Order Types are defined within custom variables, order types become available to assign as custom buttons. Once assigned as custom buttons, order types display at the register.\nReports: “Business Overview” and “Snapshot Reports.” See “Sales by Order type” section in each report.\n\nNote: “Sold-by-fraction” weight and “Container Weight” need to be the same for proper functionality. If these weights are different, container weight will not display at the Register.\n\nSpecial instructions are used with MODS at the register. This is helpful for restaurants wishing to provide additional information for the kitchen staff. Up to 14 special instruction variables can be defined.\n\nTip! Special Instructions do not change the application of a MOD at the Register; they simply convey a message to kitchen staff\n\nExample: Gluten Allergy, Peanut Allergy, Vegan\nImpact: The Register, when MODS are added. Special instructions appear on BLUE buttons in the Modifiers section.\nReports: N/A\n\nNote: “Sold-by-fraction” weight and “Container Weight” need to be the same for proper functionality. If these weights are different, container weight will not display at the register.\nSee: Create Special Instruction Modifiers\nClick here to schedule your software update today!\nInventory Setup & Management\nDifference Between Custom Buttons and Custom VariablesLast Updated: May 6, 2024\nLast Updated: May 6, 2024\nYour page rank:\nRegistered internal users can comment.

    "content": "Last Updated: \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tMarch 10, 2021\nSetting up multiple SKUs for an item allows you to track items more efficiently. Use sales trends to make informed purchasing decisions.\nExample:  You sell several special editions of a liquor which have the same volume, contents, and SKU number assigned by the manufacturer.\nUse Exatouch to assign an Alternate SKU to items bearing the same Manufacturer SKU number, then use these Alternate SKUs to track sales for each edition. Reference the sales information broken down by special edition to make an informed decision about repurchasing special edition items.\n\nClick here to schedule your software update today!\nInventory Setup & Management\nAdding & Managing Items\nGenerate SKU Numbers and Assign Alternate SKU NumbersLast Updated: March 10, 2021\nLast Updated: March 10, 2021\nYour page rank:\nRegistered internal users can comment.

View prior release →\nSave time and effort adding new items by duplicating and editing an existing item or modifier.\nDuplicating existing items allows merchants to quickly build their menu without having to build individual items and items with modifiers from scratch.\nFor example, a merchant creating a new Angus Burger in Exatouch wants it to retain the same modifiers as other burgers on the menu. This can be accomplished by using the Duplicate button under Item Details.\n\nFrom Home, navigate to Items > Item List.\nSelect an item to duplicate from the Item List screen.\nOn the Item Details screen, tap Duplicate.\nPerform the following:\nSKU: Enter or generate a new SKU.\nItem Name: Enter a name (e.g. Angus Burger) for the duplicated item.\nPrice:: Enter a price for the duplicated item, if desired.\nDescription (Optional): Enter any other description information for the duplicated item.\nTap Save.\nCheck Your Work: Navigate to the Register, select the recently duplicated item, and verify modifiers also display for that item.\nSKU and Alternate SKU fields display as blank when duplicating an item.\nOther fields possibly requiring adjustment include the following:\nVendor Name and Part Number fields\nStock Locations and Inventory fields\nPromo, Sale, and Discount settings\n\n\nDuplicating modifiers also helps merchants save time when creating a menu or expanding a menu in Exatouch. For example, a merchant can add Cajun Fries as an optional side for all entrees that already offer Onion Rings as a side.\nFrom the Item List screen, select a modifier to duplicate.\nOn the Item Details screen, tap Duplicate.\nPerform the following:\nEnter a new SKU number.\nIn the Item Name field, enter a name for the new modifier (e.g., Cajun Fries).\nEnter a new price, if necessary.\nTap Save.\nCheck Your Work: Navigate to the Register app and enter an item. The item’s newly duplicated modifier displays in the Sides column.\n\nTip! Merchants can also limit the number of modifiers allowed for a root item by adjusting the Modifier Limit setting. See: Enable Modifier Limits.\n\n\nInventory Setup & Management\nAdding & Managing Items\nAdd an ItemLast Updated: August 29, 2024\nLast Updated: August 29, 2024\nDuplicate Items and ModifiersLast Updated: January 4, 2024\nLast Updated: January 4, 2024\nYour page rank:\nRegistered internal users can comment.

Add your items to the current inventory import form, add the alpha character C as the 12th digit to 11 digit SKUs, and Exatouch generates the appropriate check digit as needed.\n\n\nThe Print Tip Slip button in the Mod Tips work area will allow users to generate a receipt for customers who’d like to add a tip to their payment. Tap to print a tip slip for your customer, then complete the transaction with tip modifications when ready.\n\n\n\nIn this update, we’ve given you the option to make Tip Security limits optional.

Your SKUs are added to the correct categories, subcategories, and are limited by Exatouch when added to an order in the Register app.\n\nNote: Default age restrictions are set to 18 and 21 and can only be changed by Support. Apply to all required products.\n\nWhen JUUL items are set up to specifications, staffers attempting to add more than the allowed quantity of items to an order will see a warning message. Clear the message, and complete the transaction that includes the allowed quantities.\n\nBack to Top\nIn this release, we’ve added the capability to add new items using your barcode scanners, and included new item filtering options to help you make purchasing decisions using expanded information in one handy work area.\n\nWe’ve expanded the item information visible during purchase order creation, putting more information right where you need it.

Finally, we’ve added support for a new in-counter scale.\n\nThe Force Clock Out option ensures staff members are clocked out appropriately at the end of the business day, or at a specific time for individual users. Disabled by default, Admin users can enable this feature by navigating to a specific user’s Staff Details work area.\n\nNote: For this feature to work, on the Preferences screen, the Clock-In Required setting must be enabled and the Clock-Out Validation setting must be disabled.

    "content": "Last Updated: \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tMay 6, 2024\nCustom buttons affect the register, allowing you to create specialized buttons on your register interface.\nCustom variables affect data fields within Exatouch, such as Item’s Details or Customer Details. Definitions of custom variables can create additional opportunities for custom buttons. For example, defining custom Customer Payout types creates the opportunity to place specific Customer Payout buttons at the register. Custom variables alone do not place buttons at the register; buttons are placed at the register via custom buttons.\n\nExample: Liquor store adds an Age Check button to their register. Age Check is an Exatouch function located by default within the global menu (right side Exatouch menu). When this merchant added an Age Check button to their register, they moved it from the global menu to a register button, giving this merchant quicker access to the age verification function.\nExample: A convenience store often issues customer payouts for lotto and scratch-offs. This merchant placed a Customer Payout button directly on their register via custom buttons, allowing them to process customer payouts quickly. For even quicker access, this merchant has also added a Lotto button via custom buttons. The “Lotto” button is a type of Quick Payout, which involves first defining custom variables before they can be placed as custom buttons. See: Setup Quick Payout\nExample: Restaurant adds “Staff Type” descriptions to their staff records to better track employee roles. “Staff Type” descriptions are defined on the Custom Vars (custom variables) tab under Settings > Preferences. This merchant defines custom variables for Staff Type as Delivery, Cashier, Manager, Sales, and OldDelivery. These custom variables appear in the Staff Type drop-down under Staff > Staff Details.\nSee: Define Custom Variables\n\nClick here to schedule your software update today!\nCustom Buttons\nDefine Custom VariablesLast Updated: June 14, 2023\nLast Updated: June 14, 2023\nAge Verification at the RegisterLast Updated: June 18, 2024\nLast Updated: June 18, 2024\nYour page rank:\nRegistered internal users can comment.

Tax Groups A, B, C, and D are designated for General Taxes.\n\nFrom Home, navigate to Settings > Tax Group Settings.\nConfirm that the General tab displays.\nSelect a Tax Group to assign.

    "content": "Last Updated: \n\t\t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tApril 9, 2024\nTax rates are configured in the Settings module. Tabs in Tax Group Settings submodule correspond to different types of taxes: General, Per Unit, and Pre & Post. On each tab, tax rates are defined in Groups. Tax Groups are labeled alphabetically (i.e. Tax Group A, Tax Group B) but can be assigned custom labels as well.\nPre & Post taxes are set up on the Pre & Post tab under the Tax Group Settings submodule. Tax Groups H and I are designated for pre-taxes and/or post-taxes.\nNote: Pre and Post taxes are NOT intended to be used to apply a surcharge. Pre and Post taxes are applied to all orders, regardless of the customer’s payment method.\nFrom Home, navigate to Settings > Tax Group Settings.\nTap the Pre & Post tab.”\nSelect Group H or Group I. We suggest selecting the first available Tax Group. For example, select Group H before Group I.\nCustomize Tax Group names by selecting a generic label name and entering a new name. For example, change “Tax Group H” to “Occupational Tax.”\nSelect either Pre or Post for the tax type.\nSelect either % or $ for the unit.\nCustomize the names of individual taxes by selecting a generic label name and entering a name. For example, change “Tax H1” to “County Tax.”\nEnter relevant tax information.\nCreate additional Tax Groups, if desired, by entering tax rates for each group (i.e. Group H and Group I).\nTap Save.\nNote: One or multiple Tax Groups can be created. For example, taxes applied to soda may be different than taxes applied to beer. In this case, you would create Group E: “Tax rates for soda” and Group F: “Tax rates for beer.”\n\n\nPre-tax amounts are applied to an item subtotal. Post-tax is an additional tax calculated after regular taxes are applied.\nPre or Post: Select either Pre or Post to indicate either a pre-tax or a post-tax.\n% or $: Select either the % or $ to indicate if the tax is a percentage applied or a specific dollar amount.\nShow On Receipt: Select to display the tax details on the customer receipt.\n\n\nPre-tax amounts are applied to an item subtotal. Once pre-tax is calculated, regular taxes are applied.\nFor example, on a $20 item calculate a regular tax of 10% after applying a 4% pre-tax: ($20 + 4% pre-tax = $20.80) + 10% overall tax = $22.88. The total tax for this transaction is $2.88.\n\n\nPost-tax is an additional tax calculated after regular taxes are applied. For example, on a $20 item calculate a regular tax of 10% + a 4% post-tax: $20 (10% regular tax + 4% post-tax) = $22.80. The total tax for this transaction is $2.80.\n\nNote: The following example is instructional only and should not be used as tax advice. Consult with your state’s department of revenue and/or your knowledgeable sales tax accountant to determine how to apply taxes in your location.\n\nOccupational Tax in Madison County, KY: Additional 1% tax on any work done outside Madison County city limits. This is a post-tax, calculated after regular taxes are applied.\n\n\nClick here to schedule your software update today!\nVideos\nTax Rate Setup\nSet General Tax RatesLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nSet Per Unit Tax RatesLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nSet Tax Rates for an Individual ItemLast Updated: October 30, 2022\nLast Updated: October 30, 2022\nSet Tax Rate for an Individual ServiceLast Updated: November 1, 2022\nLast Updated: November 1, 2022\nEBT PaymentsLast Updated: November 17, 2023\nLast Updated: November 17, 2023\nYour page rank:\nRegistered internal users can comment.

Tabs in the Tax Settings submodule correspond to different types of taxes: General, Per Unit, and Pre & Post. On each tab, tax rates are defined in Groups. Tax Groups are labeled alphabetically (i.e., Tax Group E, Tax Group F), but can be assigned custom labels too.\nPer Unit taxes are set up on the Per Unit tab. Tax Groups E, F and G on the Per Unit tab are designated for liquor, tobacco, and sweet beverage taxes. These tax groups can be assigned a “per unit” cost.\nFrom Home, navigate to Settings > Tax Group Settings.\nTap the Per Unit tab.\nSelect Group E, F, or G. We suggest selecting the first available Tax Group. For example, select Tax Group E before Tax Group F.\nCustomize Tax Group names by clicking on a generic label name and typing in a name. For example, change Tax Group E to Sin Tax.\nSelect a unit type from Unit, Gallon, Liter.\nCustomize the names of individual taxes by clicking on a generic label name and entering a name. For example, change “Tax E1” to “Beer Tax.” Change “Tax E2” to “Liquor Tax”\nEnter relevant tax rates.\nCreate additional Tax Groups by entering tax rates for each group (i.e. Group F, Group G).\nTap Save.\n\nNote: One or multiple Tax Groups can be created. For example, taxes applied to soda may be different than taxes applied to beer. In this case, create Group E: “Tax rates for soda” and Group F: “Tax rates for beer.”\n\nUnit, Gallon, and Liter: Select either Unit, Gallon or Liter to describe the measurement of the item you are taxing. For example, a Beer Tax might be $0.18 per gallon. Group E = “State Liquor Tax;” Tax E1 = “Beer Tax;” Value = 0.18. Select the Gallon checkbox.\nShow On Receipt: Select to display the tax details on customer receipt.\n\n\nNote: Examples below are instructional only and should not be used as tax advice. Consult with your state’s department of revenue and/or your knowledgeable sales tax accountant to determine how to apply taxes in your location.\n\nCounty Sin Tax for a liquor store: $0.045 per pack of cigarettes, $0.015 per 12 oz bottle of beer (equivalent to $0.580/gal), $0.60 per 750 mL bottle of wine, $0.32 per gallong mixed beverages, $0.24 per gallon hard cider, $3 per gallon hard liquor\nTax on sweet beverages in Philadelphia, PA: $0.015 per Oz for sweet beverages (equivalent to $1.92 per gallon)\n\nClick here to schedule your software update today!\nVideos\nTax Rate Setup\nSet General Tax RatesLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nSet Pre- & Post-Tax RatesLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nLast Updated: April 9, 2024\nSet Tax Rates for an Individual ItemLast Updated: October 30, 2022\nLast Updated: October 30, 2022\nSet Tax Rate for an Individual ServiceLast Updated: November 1, 2022\nLast Updated: November 1, 2022\nEBT PaymentsLast Updated: November 17, 2023\nLast Updated: November 17, 2023\nYour page rank:\nRegistered internal users can comment.
